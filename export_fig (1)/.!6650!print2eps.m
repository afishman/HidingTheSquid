%PRINT2EPS  Prints figures to eps with improved line styles
%
% Examples:
%   print2eps filename
%   print2eps(filename, fig_handle)
%   print2eps(filename, fig_handle, options)
%
% This function saves a figure as an eps file, with two improvements over
% MATLAB's print command. First, it improves the line style, making dashed
% lines more like those on screen and giving grid lines their own dotted
% style. Secondly, it substitutes original font names back into the eps
% file, where these have been changed by MATLAB, for up to 11 different
% fonts.
%
%IN:
%   filename - string containing the name (optionally including full or
%              relative path) of the file the figure is to be saved as. A
%              ".eps" extension is added if not there already. If a path is
%              not specified, the figure is saved in the current directory.
%   fig_handle - The handle of the figure to be saved. Default: gcf.
%   options - Additional parameter strings to be passed to print.

% The idea of editing the EPS file to change line styles comes from Jiro

% The idea of changing dash length with line width came from comments on
% fex id: 5743, but the implementation is mine :)

% 14/11/2011: Fix a MATLAB bug rendering black or white text incorrectly.
%             Thanks to Mathieu Morlighem for reporting the issue and
%             obtaining a fix from TMW.
% 08/12/11: Added ability to correct fonts. Several people have requested
%           this at one time or another, and also pointed me to printeps
%           (fex id: 7501), so thank you to them. My implementation (which
%           was not inspired by printeps - I'd already had the idea for my
%           approach) goes slightly further in that it allows multiple
%           fonts to be swapped.
% 14/12/11: Fix bug affecting font names containing spaces. Thanks to David
%           Szwer for reporting the issue.
% 25/01/12: Add a font not to be swapped. Thanks to Anna Rafferty and Adam
%           Jackson for reporting the issue. Also fix a bug whereby using a
%           font alias can lead to another font being swapped in.
% 10/04/12: Make the font swapping case insensitive.
% 26/10/12: Set PaperOrientation to portrait. Thanks to Michael Watts for
%           reporting the issue.
% 26/10/12: Fix issue to do with swapping fonts changing other fonts and
%           sizes we don't want, due to listeners. Thanks to Malcolm Hudson
%           for reporting the issue.
% 22/03/13: Extend font swapping to axes labels. Thanks to Rasmus Ischebeck
%           for reporting the issue.
% 23/07/13: Bug fix to font swapping. Thank to George for reporting the
%           issue.
% 13/08/13: Fix MATLAB feature of not exporting white lines correctly.
